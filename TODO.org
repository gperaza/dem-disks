Write results to files: Phase space, link statistics, contact status, forces.
We need additional data structures to do this.

Change the sinusoidal excitation to be in the direction of gravity. So
far calculations in the model assume this. Experimentally what we have
done is also this. Check this is correct. This does not change the
case of zero tilt, so our results for packings remain correct.

Check the gear predictor corrector coefficients.
